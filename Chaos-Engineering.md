## Chaos engineering

Testing in production (TiP) is gaining steam as an accepted practice in DevOps and testing communities, but no amount of preproduction QA testing can foresee all the possible scenarios in your real production deployment. The prevailing wisdom is that you will see failures in production; the only question is whether you'll be surprised by them or inflict them intentionally to test system resilience and learn from the experience. The latter approach is chaos engineering.
